# Hide Components when keyboard is shown

Devices screen are small especially when the keyboard takes half the space,
when you're working with forms for instance.  
One of the best way to handle that is to hide part of the view when the keyboard
shows up.

## Install it
```
npm install -S react-native-hide-with-keyboard
```

## Use it
```javascript
import HideWithKeyboard from 'react-native-hide-with-keyboard';

...

render() {
  return (
      <View>
        <HideWithKeyboard>
          <Text>Hidden when keyboard is shown</Text>
        </HideWithKeyboard>
        <Text>Never hidden</Text>
      </View>
    )
}
```

### _Show_ components when keyboard is shown
In the case that you want to do the opposite, there is also `ShowWithKeyboard` which only shows a component when the keyboard is displayed. To use this, instead importÂ `react-native-hide-with-keyboard` like so:
```javascript
import { HideWithKeyboard, ShowWithKeyboard } from 'react-native-hide-with-keyboard';
```
